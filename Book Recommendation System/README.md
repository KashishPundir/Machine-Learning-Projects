# 📚 **Book Recommender System**
This project is a Book Recommendation System built using Python and Pandas that leverages real-world data to suggest books based on user ratings. The notebook performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implements a basic recommendation algorithm.

## 🔍 **Overview:**
The system uses collaborative filtering and popularity-based methods to recommend books. It provides:

## 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
📈 Visualization of book rating distributions  
⭐ Average rating per book  
📚 Most popular books based on user ratings  
✅ Cleaned and structured dataset for recommendations  

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used:**  
▪ Python 3  
▪ Numpy  
▪ Pandas  
▪ Matplotlib  
▪ Seaborn     
▪ Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 **Dataset Description:**
The dataset consists of three main files:  

Books.csv – Contains book titles, ISBNs, authors, etc.  
Users.csv – User demographics  
Ratings.csv – User-book rating interactions  

These files are merged and cleaned to form the final dataset used in this project.

## 🚀 **How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
3. Open the notebook: **Book_Recommender_System.ipynb**
