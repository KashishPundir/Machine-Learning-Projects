# 🎬 **Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews**
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. It classifies each review as either positive or negative, helping understand audience reception automatically and at scale.

## 📌 **Project Objective:**  
To build a robust sentiment analysis model that can:  
🔹Process textual data from IMDB movie reviews.  
🔹Preprocess the data using NLP techniques.  
🔹Train multiple machine learning classifiers.  
🔹Predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.  
🔹Visualize important insights using charts and metrics.  

## 🛠️ **Technologies & Libraries Used:**  
🔸Python  
🔸Jupyter Notebook  
🔸Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation  
🔸Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization  
🔸NLTK – Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords, stemming)  
🔸Scikit-learn – ML models   
🔸TfidfVectorizer – Feature extraction from text  

## 🚀 **How to Run the Project:**
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-imdb.git
cd sentiment-analysis-imdb
```
2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn
```
3. Run the notebook:<br>
    a) Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.<br>
    b) Execute the cells step-by-step.

5. Ensure necessary NLTK corpora are downloaded:
```bash
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
```
