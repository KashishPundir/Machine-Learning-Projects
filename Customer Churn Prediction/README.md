# 🔍 **Customer Churn Prediction**

## 🚀 **Project Overview:**
This project aims to predict customer churn using advanced machine learning techniques. It helps businesses proactively identify customers who are at risk of leaving, so that targeted retention strategies can be implemented to improve customer loyalty and reduce revenue loss.

## 📦 **Dataset:**  
The dataset includes customer attributes such as:  
🔹**Demographics:** gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents  
🔹**Service usage:** InternetService, PhoneService, StreamingTV, OnlineSecurity  
🔹**Account info:** tenure, Contract, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges  
🔹**Target:** Churn (Yes/No)  

## 🧠 **Workflow & Features:**  
✔️ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
– Handled missing values and categorical encoding  
– Converted numerical features to proper formats  
– Feature engineering for better model performance   

✔️ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
– Visualized churn distribution and correlations
– Uncovered patterns in customer behavior  

✔️ **Model Building**  
Trained and evaluated multiple ML models:    
→ Logistic Regression  
→ Random Forest   
→ XGBoost  
→ Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning  
→ Achieved high accuracy and recall for churn class  

✔️ **Churn Probability Prediction**  
– Predict churn for any input customer profile   
– Model outputs churn likelihood with insights  

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used:**  
• Python (Jupyter Notebook)   
• Pandas, NumPy  
• Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
• Matplotlib, Seaborn
